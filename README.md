# Rainydays

I have made a functional site for Rainydays with html and css. I started by making all the pages in html and went on with styling in css. I have had major issues with media queries and have tried to change my css codes and IÂ´m still working on how to fix that. 

I had a hard time making the same fonts as in my prototype in Figma so I have used Roboto instead. I excluded the horizontal lines in the footer because I could not manage how to make them in css. I also excluded the grey background on the check out page because I could not find any information on how to make background colors on just some parts of the page. 
I have used a different image on the home page than in Figma because I unfortunately could not find the image I used in my prototype.

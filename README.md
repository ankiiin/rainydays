# Rainydays

## A functional website for Rainydays using HTML and CSS.

This project is a functional website built for my student assignment from my prototype in Figma.

Creating different pages as listed in the architecture of the chosen brief such as:
* Home page
* About page
* Contact page
* Product page
* Check out page
* A few extra pages

Issues:

I have had major issues with media queries and have tried to change my css codes and IÂ´m still working on how to fix that. I will get back when this has been fixed. Figured the mistake where I have used position:absolute on every code which will not work with the media queries. I will now have to go through everything since nothing will be in position after i remove position:absolute. 

Changes from prototype:

I had a hard time making the same fonts as in my prototype in Figma so I have used Roboto instead. I excluded the horizontal lines in the footer because I could not manage how to make them in css. I also excluded the grey background on the check out page because I could not find any information on how to make background colors on just some parts of the page. 
I have used a different image on the home page than in Figma because I unfortunately could not find the image I used in my prototype.

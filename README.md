# Rainydays

## A functional website for Rainydays using HTML and CSS.

This project is a functional website built for my student assignment from my prototype in Figma.

Creating different pages as listed in the architecture of the chosen brief such as:
* Home page
* About page
* Contact page
* Product page
* Check out page
* A few extra pages

Issues:

I have had some issues with media queries and have tried to change my css codes and IÂ´m still working on how to fix that. I will get back when this has been fixed. Figured the mistake where I have used position:absolute on every code which will not work with the media queries. I will now have to go through everything since nothing will be in position after i remove position:absolute. 
Unfortunately the image on the home page where the CTA "explore whats new" is not possible to make high quality.

Changes from prototype:

I had a hard time making the same fonts as in my prototype in Figma, so I have used Roboto instead.
I have used a different image on the home page than in Figma because I unfortunately could not find the image I used in my prototype. 
I decided to not have the back button on the products pages because I was not very happy with the design when I added that. 
The checkoutform on the checkout page is listed under each other instead of having first name and last name next to each other simply because I think the design looks better like that. 
I have used a white background on the images in the checkout page simply because I think it looks better.
To make the menubar available when scrolling down the pages I had to change the logo to be underneath the menubar.

References:
I want to thank Eric and Brian for the help I got on the special effects like the grey background on the items in the check out page, and the cta button on the image on home page.
